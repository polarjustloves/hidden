# what is this?

This is a complete rewrite of my old 8-ball script. It will not be open-source as 8ball was, as I noticed that features I created made were spread within the community (yes, I said it was okay to use with or without credit, but not to claim you made it} a lot private and public scripts did this, though they were poorly made they still were used in that way. hidden will be more supported, and better overall.
